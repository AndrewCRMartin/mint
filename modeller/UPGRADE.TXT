Thanks for your EMail. The problem was that the command for defining
the refinement method in Modeller changed between Version 12 and the
new Modeller3 so the scripts generated by Mint fail. I've only
recently upgraded to Modeller3 myself and, unfortunately, Andrej
didn't tell me that he'd made this change earlier...

A new version of Mint which should work correctly with Modeller3
is available via my Web page:

http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/~martin/#programs

In the mean time, you can edit the .top files generated by Mint1.3
and simply delete the line:
   SET FINISH_METHOD = 'refine'
Modeller3 will then takes its default behaviour which is full
refinement equivalent to FINISH_METHOD = 'refine'. The variable
which has replaced FINISH_METHOD is MD_LEVEL --- take a look
in the Modeller3 manual for details.


Hope this helps,


Best wishes,

Andrew
