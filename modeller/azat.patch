The solution which was suggested for hydrogen works in your case too.
The problem of "bad" output PDB files was related to wrong method of
building the coordinates (3D_INTERPOLATION), which should be replaced
now (as it is shown in the attached .top file or as above).

Please also find the modified .top file you've sent me in attachment

Azat.
