To install MINT, proceed as follows:


1. Unpack the archive into a new directory


2. Create the environment variable MINTDIR to point to this directory.
This should be done in your .cshrc or .profile file in your home
directory or done system-wide with the rest of Modeller.
For example, if you have unpacked the files into the directory:
/usr/local/src/mint, you would use the following under the
C-shell:

setenv MINTDIR /usr/local/src/mint

or, under Bourne-like shells:

export MINTDIR=/usr/local/src/mint


3. Edit the file mint_local.tcl such that the modeller variable is set
to point to the Modeller executable. You should also alter the pdbdir,
pdbext and pdbprep variables for the location of the PDB at your site.
Note that the PDB directory must be specified with the trailing slash
and the extension with the leading dot. For example, if you store PDB 
files as /pdb/pdbXXXX.ent, you should set these as follows:

set pdbdir      /pdb/
set pdbext      .ent
set pdbprep     pdb

If you are using MINT with the academic version of Modeller, you should
set the variable `routine_homol' to "model"; if you are using the MSI
version which comes as an extension package for Quanta, you should set 
this to "homol" (for some reason, MSI have changed the name of this
macro).

Currently, you shouldn't need to change the value of the
`routine_fhomol' variable, but this may be changed should MSI (or
Andrej Sali) decide to change the name of this macro.

If desired, you can also change the button colours.


4. If you do not have Tcl/Tk and the Wish shell installed, you
should obtain and install them. If you do not keep the wish command
in the directory /usr/local/bin, you should edit mint.tcl and
change the first line accordingly.


5. Compile the pdb2seg program by typing `make' at the Unix prompt.


6. Create a link from mint.tcl to the command `mint' somewhere in 
your path. For example:

ln -s /usr/local/modeller/mint.tcl /usr/local/bin/mint 


7. Run MINT by typing the command:

mint
